combine map and sky parts where possible

late/missing indicator

why so many inactive planes, even at the start?
ah, seems these are planes that are in the query results, yet haven't have data updates in a long time?
e.g. directly after startup:
[SK info] Marking plane 484257 (KT) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 279.398s
[SK info] Marking plane 06e010 (RWD701) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 131.398s

simplify plane model

rotate map text based on head pos

indicator for HL temperature and framerate?

check use of geometric altitude for sky mode

allow map speciication, including image?, through qr code
- map name (for UI)
- lat/lon extents
- either: zoom level (OSM), or URL to custom map image

fps graph

reset track lines button (+ max length?)
