add log window

combine map and sky parts where possible

late/missing indicator

align opensky query area with map area

why so many inactive planes, even at the start?

rotate map text based on head pos

indicator for HL temperature?

check use of geometric altitude for sky mode

allow map speciication, including image?, through qr code
- map name (for UI)
- lat/lon extents
- either: zoom level (OSM), or URL to custom map image

fps graph

reset track lines button (+ max length?)


HoloLens2 doesn't support GPS Sensor, but an app can acquire the user's current location via Wi-Fi. It is less precise but more likely to be available indoors. You can invoke the Windows Runtime API Geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync method in the Windows.Devices.Geolocation namespace to retrieve the current location of the device.
