make plane text darker (bluer?) again

hide plane that are outside the map extent

delete missing planes (but keep track of number deleted)
add late and forgotten count
on ground


json: observer id -> name


use all observers from json

handling OSM tiling

run Tex.FromFile on loading thread if possible, as it briefly interrupts all rendering
for large images

add surf logo

highlight airport locations

put compass rose at observer location and orientation

callsign-only text is sometimes too low


allow text size selection

combine map and sky parts where possible during drawing?

fps graph

allow settings to be specified in qr codes, for easy demo setup


Ideas:
- HoloLens2 doesn't support GPS Sensor, but an app can acquire the user's current location via Wi-Fi. It is less precise but more likely to be available indoors. You can invoke the Windows Runtime API Geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync method in the Windows.Devices.Geolocation namespace to retrieve the current location of the device.

- for map view don't extrapolate based on last point, but interpolate based on last 2 points

Check:
- why so many inactive planes, even at the start?
  ah, seems these are planes that are in the query results, yet haven't have data updates in a long time?
  e.g. directly after startup:
   [SK info] Marking plane 484257 (KT) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 279.398s
  [SK info] Marking plane 06e010 (RWD701) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 131.398s
