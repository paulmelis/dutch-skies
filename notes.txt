option to filter map planes based on map extents versus query extents

refactor data handling

why so many inactive planes, even at the start?
ah, seems these are planes that are in the query results, yet haven't have data updates in a long time?
e.g. directly after startup:
[SK info] Marking plane 484257 (KT) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 279.398s
[SK info] Marking plane 06e010 (RWD701) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 131.398s

delete missing planes (but keep track of number deleted)
add late and forgotten count
on ground

allow text size selection

callsign-only text is sometimes too low

highlight airport locations

allow map speciication, including image?, through qr code
- map name (for UI)
- lat/lon extents
- either: zoom level (OSM), or URL to custom map image

rotate map text based on head pos

combine map and sky parts where possible

align opensky query area with map area

HoloLens2 doesn't support GPS Sensor, but an app can acquire the user's current location via Wi-Fi. It is less precise but more likely to be available indoors. You can invoke the Windows Runtime API Geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync method in the Windows.Devices.Geolocation namespace to retrieve the current location of the device.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.geolocation.geolocator.getgeopositionasync?view=winrt-22000#Windows_Devices_Geolocation_Geolocator_GetGeopositionAsync

allow settings to be specified in qr codes, for easy demo setup


idea: for map view don't extrapolate based on last point, but interpolate based on last 2 points...
