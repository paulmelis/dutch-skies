planes are slightly off wrt the map in the NL config, compared to the builtin config...

use Windows.Data.Json instead of SimpleJSON

use monospace font for log window?

allow option to use per-map query extent in a set, instead of union of all map extents

when switching map set immediately query an opensky update?

when alignment solution is applied, observer windrose needs to move
to current position (and not original observer position), plus
its orientation will need to be based on the true North, instead of
transformed startup Forward direction

could show actual observer location after alignment solution?
if we can find a way to map back to lat, lon


guard against empty id's and names in configs

clear observer name on button when none is available

add surf logo

new york json: query area incorrect?

ignore map images that got fetched after a new config was loaded

observer: null should clean observer and set to map[0] center

Bugs:
- When switching configs the sky trails sometimes use incorrect previous pos
- when no observer is set map center is used, yet it is't precisely equal to the initial map center reported?


Should have:
- About window
- More robust JSON parser
- Highlight airport locations

Nice to have:
- Reset back to internals maps
- Reset MR origin option (to recenter at current position)
- Run Tex.FromFile on loading thread if possible, as it briefly interrupts all rendering for large images
- Allow settings to be specified in qr codes, for easy demo setup
- FPS graph
- Allow text size selection
- Delete missing planes (but keep track of number deleted)?
- Allow specifying altitude of lowest point on map and offset planes by that amount

Optimize:
- Combine map and sky parts where possible during drawing

Ideas:
- HoloLens2 doesn't support GPS Sensor, but an app can acquire the user's current location via Wi-Fi. It is less precise but more likely to be available indoors. You can invoke the Windows Runtime API Geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync method in the Windows.Devices.Geolocation namespace to retrieve the current location of the device.

- for map view don't extrapolate based on last point, but interpolate based on last 2 points

Check:
- why so many inactive planes, even at the start?
  ah, seems these are planes that are in the query results, yet haven't have data updates in a long time?
  e.g. directly after startup:
   [SK info] Marking plane 484257 (KT) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 279.398s
  [SK info] Marking plane 06e010 (RWD701) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 131.398s
