fetch url: show exception message

new york json: query area incorrect?

"got update query extent" minus signs

disable startup enqueued config

put loaded config in title

ignore map images that got fetched after a new config was loaded

landmarks: [] should clean landmarks
observer: null should clean observer and set to map[0] center

Bugs:
- When switching configs the sky trails sometimes use incorrect previous pos

Should have:
- About window
- More robust JSON parser
- Highlight airport locations

Nice to have:
- Reset back to internals maps
- Reset MR origin option (to recenter at current position)
- Run Tex.FromFile on loading thread if possible, as it briefly interrupts all rendering for large images
- Allow settings to be specified in qr codes, for easy demo setup
- FPS graph
- Allow text size selection
- Delete missing planes (but keep track of number deleted)?
- Allow specifying altitude of lowest point on map and offset planes by that amount

Optimize:
- Combine map and sky parts where possible during drawing

Ideas:
- HoloLens2 doesn't support GPS Sensor, but an app can acquire the user's current location via Wi-Fi. It is less precise but more likely to be available indoors. You can invoke the Windows Runtime API Geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync method in the Windows.Devices.Geolocation namespace to retrieve the current location of the device.

- for map view don't extrapolate based on last point, but interpolate based on last 2 points

Check:
- why so many inactive planes, even at the start?
  ah, seems these are planes that are in the query results, yet haven't have data updates in a long time?
  e.g. directly after startup:
   [SK info] Marking plane 484257 (KT) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 279.398s
  [SK info] Marking plane 06e010 (RWD701) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 131.398s
