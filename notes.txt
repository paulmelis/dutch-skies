add surf logo

Should have:
- More robust JSON parser
- Highlight airport locations
- attribution on generated OSM map images

Nice to have:
- Reset origin option (to recenter)
- Run Tex.FromFile on loading thread if possible, as it briefly interrupts all rendering for large images
- Allow settings to be specified in qr codes, for easy demo setup
- FPS graph
- Allow text size selection
- When no query range is given, set it to range of first map
- Delete missing planes (but keep track of number deleted)?

Optimize:
- Combine map and sky parts where possible during drawing

Ideas:
- HoloLens2 doesn't support GPS Sensor, but an app can acquire the user's current location via Wi-Fi. It is less precise but more likely to be available indoors. You can invoke the Windows Runtime API Geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync method in the Windows.Devices.Geolocation namespace to retrieve the current location of the device.

- for map view don't extrapolate based on last point, but interpolate based on last 2 points

Check:
- why so many inactive planes, even at the start?
  ah, seems these are planes that are in the query results, yet haven't have data updates in a long time?
  e.g. directly after startup:
   [SK info] Marking plane 484257 (KT) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 279.398s
  [SK info] Marking plane 06e010 (RWD701) LATE, as we haven't had data updates in 131.398s
